# EdgeTX-Log-Charts
Python script to generate charts from EdgeTX log data

Most of this code was generated by ChatGPT using the following prompt:
```
Your job is to analyse the uploaded EDGETX Drone log file saved to the transmitter handset and plot charts from the data. The format of the log file is CSV with the first line being the column names and subsequent lines being the actual data.
Plot the following charts using different y-axes for each data set:
1) ELRS link quality chart. The x axis is "Time" and the y axis has "RQly(%)", "1RSS(dB)", "2RSS(dB)" and "RSNR(dB)"
2) Battery chart. The x axis is "Time" and the y axis is "Curr(A)", "RxBt(V)" and "Capa(mAh)".
3) GPS chart. The x axis is "Time" and the y axis is "Sats"
4) Motion chart. The x axis is "Time" and the y axis is "Alt(m)", "GSpd(kmh)"
5) Map. This plots the motion of the drone on a chart using the "GPS" coordinates which is in the format LAT, space, Long.
6) Noise Map. Plot a map so that the colors of the line reflect the noise level as captured in the RSNR(db) data. It should be a color gradient, ranging from green being the highest RSNS(db) value through yellow and orange to red being the lowest RSNR(db) value. Use the time to match the two datasets.
Do not plot grid lines
